This is our repository for our amazing and wonderful Website

Ideas: 
    ((- Stocks App)) 
    (- App based on weather data)
    - App based on Map data 
        - e.g. hiking recommendations 
            - based on 
              - proximity to user
              - start/end point
              - distance of hike 
              - (combination with weather depending on region maybe?)
              - accessibility by public transport
              
            - maybe expand to different activities aswell, e.g. biking, swimming etc. 
              - make a map-based tool where it recommends activities based on the area you choose 
              - possible extensions might be public transport, food, hotels, places of interest, etc.
              
              - special feature: 

            


    - nutrition App thingy 
        - user input: calories, protein etc.; desired weight gain/loss; 
        - (maybe muscle gain) 
        - differentiate between age groups, gender, protein intake, type of exercise
